# Vendor Management Web App

This project is a vendor management web application developed as part of an internship assignment with Team JS Tigers. The application enables users to manage vendor information efficiently, including adding new vendors, editing existing vendor details, and deleting vendors.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React.js or Next.js
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- Backend:
  - Node.js (if using React.js)
  - Express.js
  - SQL or NoSQL Database Management System (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)

## Features

1. **Google Login & Logout:** Users can securely sign in using their Google accounts and log out when required.

2. **Create Vendor:** Users can add new vendors by filling in mandatory details such as Vendor Name, Bank Account Number, Bank Name, Address, City, Country, and Zip Code.

3. **Display Paginated List of Vendors:** The application displays a paginated list of vendors, showing essential information like Vendor Name, Bank Account Number, and Bank Name. Links for editing or deleting vendors are provided.

4. **Edit Vendor Details:** Users can update vendor information by accessing the edit vendor screen, where existing details are preloaded for easy modification. Changes are saved upon submission.

5. **Delete Vendor:** The application allows users to delete vendors after confirming the action, providing a safeguard against accidental deletions.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the database connection in the backend.
